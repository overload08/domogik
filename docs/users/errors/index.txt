    Dammit, my Domogik system is not working, how can I solve my issue ?

    -- From you, who are reading this page 

First don't forget to :

* check the log files for errors
* check the process status 
* check if services are available
* check if xPL is working fine

Check the log files
-------------------

Log files are available in :

* **/var/log/domogik/** for Domogik
* **/var/log/xplhub/** for the python xPL hub

You an find all the errors with this command: ::

    $ grep ERROR /var/log/domogik/*

Example: ::

    /var/log/domogik/manager.log:2013-12-06 14:35:24,371 domogik-manager ERROR Package plugin-onewire : invalid json file
    /var/log/domogik/manager.log:2013-12-06 14:35:24,371 domogik-manager ERROR Package plugin-onewire : Error validating the json: key 'xpl' not found in a param for device_type onewire.serial_number

Check the process status
------------------------

Assuming the Domogik user is *domogik*, do the following checks:

* check all main components are up: 

    ::

        $ ps -fu domogik | grep dmg_

    You must have one process for the *MQ broker* and one for the *MQ forwarder*: ::

        domogik    32562     1  1 14:12 ?        00:00:23 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/dmg_broker
        domogik    32583     1  0 14:12 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/dmg_forwarder

    You must have one process for the python hub: ::

        domogik    32605     1  0 14:12 ?        00:00:06 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/dmg_hub

    Check the manager is running: ::

        domogik    32642      1  0 14:12 ?        00:00:09 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/dmg_manager -d -r -x -s

    See if the admin interface is running: ::

        domogik      336      1  0 14:12 ?        00:00:06 /usr/bin/python /media/stock/domotique/git/domogik/src/domogik/bin/admin.py
    
    Check if xplgw is up: ::

        $ ps -fu domogik | grep xplgw
        domogik    32735      1  0 14:12 ?        00:00:13 /usr/bin/python /media/stock/domotique/git/domogik/src/domogik/bin/xplgw.py

    If one component is not up, check its log files. If the component is *admin*, *scenario*, *butler* or *xplgw* and you find no logs, check in the *manager* logs.

Check if services are available
-------------------------------

You can use the following command on your server to check all ports where a service is listening. Notice that Domogik uses by default ports in 404xx range. ::

    $ netstat -tnpl | grep 404

If the administration web interface is up, you will see (depending on your network configuration): ::
    
    tcp        0      0 192.168.1.10:40406      0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      336/python
    tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:40406         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      336/python

If message queue broket and forwarder are up, you will see: ::
    
    tcp        0      0 192.168.1.10:40410      0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      32562/python
    tcp        0      0 192.168.1.10:40411      0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      32583/python
    tcp        0      0 192.168.1.10:40412      0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      32583/python

You can find more informations about the used ports in the technical documentation.


Check if xPL is working fine
----------------------------

If you think xPL is not working, do: ::

    $ grep "HUB discovery" /var/log/domogik/xplgw.log

You should have the following lines: ::

    2013-12-06 14:12:23,435 domogik-xplgw INFO HUB discovery > starting
    2013-12-06 14:12:23,436 domogik-xplgw INFO HUB discovery > looking for the hub. I hope there is one hub, Domogik won't work without the hub!
    2013-12-06 14:12:23,438 domogik-xplgw INFO HUB discovery > Received HBEAT echo, HUB detected
    2013-12-06 14:12:23,438 domogik-xplgw INFO HUB discovery > hub found, configuration in progress

If the following lines appears always, it means that the xPL hub is not found. So you should check your configuration or network access (firewall, ...): ::

    2013-12-06 14:12:23,435 domogik-xplgw INFO HUB discovery > starting
    2013-12-06 14:13:33,436 domogik-xplgw INFO HUB discovery > looking for the hub. I hope there is one hub, Domogik won't work without the hub!
    2013-12-06 14:13:35,436 domogik-xplgw INFO HUB discovery > looking for the hub. I hope there is one hub, Domogik won't work without the hub!
    2013-12-06 14:13:37,436 domogik-xplgw INFO HUB discovery > looking for the hub. I hope there is one hub, Domogik won't work without the hub!
    2013-12-06 14:13:39,436 domogik-xplgw INFO HUB discovery > looking for the hub. I hope there is one hub, Domogik won't work without the hub!

The python xPL hub configuration is set in **/etc/domogik/xplhub.cfg**. The logs are in **/var/log/xplhub/**



Domogik 0.1/0.2/0.3 errors (that may still happen in 0.4)
=========================================================

libmysqlclient issue on Ubuntu 12.04
------------------------------------

Error
*****

::

    ImportError: libmysqlclient_r.so.16: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


Solution
********

Ubuntu install the libmysqlclient in release 18. Just create a symlink: ::

    ln -v /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libmysqlclient_r.so.18 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libmysqlclient_r.so.16


xPL Hub doesn't start (C version) 
---------------------------------

Error
*****

When manually launching the xPL Hub, you get: ::

    $ ./xPL_Hub                                                                       
    bash: ./xPL_Hub: Aucun fichier ou dossier de ce type

Cause
*****

You may be on a 64bits system with no 32bits glibc library

Solution
********

Install the 32bits glibc. Example for Archlinux: ::

    pacman -S lib32-glibc


REST is slow
------------

Error
*****

For example, the config page of plugins takes more than 5 seconds to be displayed

Cause
*****

Definitely due to DNS issue. Check rest.log times, especially the time between :
* domogik-rest DEBUG Send HTTP header for OK, and 
* domogik-rest DEBUG Send HTTP data : {...}
If the difference is something like 5s, your DNS setup may be bad.

Solution
********

If you have ''avahi'' running (at least on a Ubuntu Desktop install), it could be stopped unless you know that you need it. That should solve your problem.
If you don't have such software, check your DNS setup, one quick way to check (without using domogik) is to run the command ::

    time getent hosts the.ip.of.client

If it takes long time without any answer, your setup is wrong.

Solution with a karotz on the LAN
*********************************

You must assign a host name to your Karotz on your local network.
