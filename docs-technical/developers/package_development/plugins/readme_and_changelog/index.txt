==========================
Readme and changelog files
==========================

These 2 files are needed in package root directory:

* README.md
* CHANGELOG

README.md
=========

The **README.md** file should contain a quick description of the plugin, and invite the user to find more informations on http://docs.domogik.org/

The **.md** extension is for *Markdown* which is a text markup language. You can find `more information about Markdown on wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`_

You may create the file like this: ::

    $ echo " # Purpose
    
    This is a package for Domogik : http://www.domogik.org
    
    Domogik is an open source home automation solution.
    
    # Documentation 
    
    You can find the documentation source in the **docs/** folder. When the package will be installed, the documentation will be available in the **Documentation** menu of the Domogik administration for this package.
    You may also find online documentation for this plugin. You will be able to find the documentation url on http://repo-public.domogik.org/dashboard
    
    # Install the package
    
    To install this package on your Domogik system, you can go in this GitHub repository releases page and get the link to a release .zip file. Then you just have to do :
    
        dmg_package -i http://path.to/the/file.zip" > README.md




CHANGELOG
=========

The real changelog file must be located in **docs/changelog.txt**. To allow the user to find it quickly, please create a CHANGELOG in the root directory like this: ::

    echo "The changelog informations are available in docs/changelog.txt" > CHANGELOG
